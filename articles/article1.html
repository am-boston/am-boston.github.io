    <p class="article_text" style="overflow: hidden;"> Since the onset of the pandemic,
    <a href="https://ampsnys.org/">Ananda Marga’s New York Sector</a> (AMNYS) has worked tirelessly 
    to help people across the community handle the stresses and spiritual reckoning that have come with it. 
    The Spring Festival of 2021 was no different. On Thursday, April 22th to Sunday, April 25th, AMNYS hosted 
    a four day Spring Festival in honor of philosopher, leader, and spiritual guru Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar’s 
    centennial birthday. The festival celebrated everything from the new life that comes with spring, 
    to the newest frontiers in thought and research that 
    has come about in the past few months. It was such an honor to be there. <br><br>

    <a href="https://ampsnys.org/">Ananda Marga</a> is a socio-spiritual organization that hopes to reach people through a combination of 
    spiritual practice and social service. On Thursday, we started off with a traditional <a href="https://ampsnys.org/"> Dharma Cakra </a>, 
    <a href="https://ampsnys.org/">meditation</a>, and a three-hour<a href="https://ampsnys.org/">kiirtan</a>. 
    We then ended with a video of Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, and some more kiirtan. <br><br>

    Friday was jam-packed with presentations on Sampkalpa of Mahasambhuti, Sarkar’s contribution on spirituality, 
    a Centennial Overview presentation, Sarkar’s contribution to the arts and the origin of the Renaissance 
    Universal (<a href="https://ampsnys.org/">RU</a>), and an exhibition of pictures and stories from people who had the fortune to interact with 
    Sarkar. Several of the most talented and hard working artists in the area also presented some of their work 
    from AM’s Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (<a href="https://ampsnys.org/">RAWA</a>). There was kiirtan and meditation throughout the 
    day as well. For me, one of the most memorable moments on Friday was seeing both hearing the incredible 
    stories of the senior Margiis’ interaction with Sarkar, as well as all of the incredible performances from 
    such young people across the Northeast. There was dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, poetry, and 
    more. Frankly, it was inspiring. </p>

    <p class="article_text" style="overflow: hidden;">
    On Saturday, we started off with the traditional Dharma Chakra, followed by presentations on History of 
    Sarkar’s childhood and an overview of Ananda Nagar, a series of talks on Neohumanistic Education (<a href="https://ampsnys.org/">NHE</a>), 
    and a panel discussion on Sarkar’s contribution to a new model of Economic Democracy -- <a href="https://ampsnys.org/">PROUT</a>. This was, 
    by far, the most dense part of the festival. We learned all about the practical implementations of Sarkar’s 
    philosophy, whether it be through global education, economic democracy, disaster relief, or service in general. 
    We were also lucky enough to close out with another round of RAWA performances and a video of one of Sarkar’s 
    discourses, which were as beautiful and inspiring. For me, one of the most incredible parts of the day was 
    learning about NHE and PROUT-- before, I didn’t know much about the philosophy, and the presenters provided 
    a quick and easy to understand primer.

    <br><br>

    Sunday was the last day of the program. We started bright and early at 5:30 AM with a Dharma Cakra, 
    followed by kiirtan for 3 hours. Then, we had a final series of presentations on the exciting work 
    happening at <a href="https://ampsnys.org/">Master Units</a> across the country. The Master Units are not only self-sufficient central 
    points for Ananda Marga, devotees, and monks, but they’re also known widely for their extensive social 
    service programs, including but not limited to schools, clinics, yoga and meditation centers, and farms. 
    We closed the program with a Dharma Chakra, kiirtan, and public comments from the participants and organizers alike.
