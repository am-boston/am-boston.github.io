    <p class="figure_text" style="overflow: hidden;">A quote by Baba, as presented by Acarya Satyamitrananda.</p>

    <p class="article_text" style="overflow: hidden;"> This weekend, I had the opportunity of attending 
    Ananda Marga’s New York Sector Spring Festival. It was not only an opportunity to learn more about
     out spiritual guru, Prabhat Ranhan Sarkar (Baba), but also an incredible talks from some of the pioneering 
     philosophies and projects in AM today. These include, but are not limited to: Neohumanistic Education, 
     Economic Democracy and PROUT, and Renaissance Artists and Writers Association.<br><br>

    I was particularly interested in Neohumanistic education because, while I had read some of 
    Sarkar’s book on Neohumanism, there was still much I had yet to learn. Dada Satyamitrananda 
    and Dada Dhanjoo Ghista both gave presentations on Neohumanistic Education (hereafter NHE) on Saturday. 
    I’ll try to cover the basics of what I understood from the retreat. <br><br>

    To quote Baba, “Real education leads to a pervasive sense of love and compassion for all creation”. 
    Baba created NHE to teach people to automatically care for each other, then nature, then the environment, 
    and have respect for everyone. He predicted that once this kind of outlook is established, it will allow 
    communities to solve the world’s problems on their own. One of the biggest goals of Ananda Marga is to 
    establish this Neohumanistic education.<br><br>
    
    In the first presentation, Dada Satyamitrananda talked of the basics of Neohumanism. He remarked that 
    the human mind is “dominated by sentiments and psychologies”. People often react to trauma and past 
    experiences with a sense of attachment. For example, a person who was raised in a period of war often 
    has fear and anger complexes. On another note, the majority of society and media is focused on extroversial 
    things like extreme wealth, fame, beauty, etc. He asks the simple question, “how do we find balance in this 
    kind of love?” According to Dada Satyamitrananda, the answer lies in Sarkar’s teachings of global love, devotion, 
    and acceptance. <br><br>

    The NHE model is based on the relationship between the teacher and child. Teachers must be selected 
    carefully, and not necessarily only on academic qualifications. Teachers are role models, and 
    essentially unseen heroes for many students. Therefore, they need to have (among many): Personal integrity, 
    strength of character, righteousness, unselfish, inspiring personality, leadership, and a feeling for social 
    service. This will ensure that we provide the best role models to our children, and role models are one of the most practical 
    method of learning. 

    <br><br>

    Secondly, teachers themselves need to inspire the student for learning, and create a joy for learning 
    in every student. This can be done by immersing children in collective and low-stress learning environments 
    as soon as they start growing. A love for learning may or may not be inbuilt-- but, by rewarding it whenever
     they can, teachers can make sure that it is an integral part of the classroom experience. The end goal 
     is that students should be open minded, think globally, be practical and creative, have communication 
     skills and intelligence, contemplation and introspection, self-restraint, self-discipline, lead a balanced 
     life, let go of ego, have confidence and the ability to act, problem solving. By setting the right example, 
     immersing students in the right environments, teaching meditation and universal love, and rewarding learning 
     over test scores, Dada Satyamitrananda and Dr. Ghista argue that we can reform the education system for the better.

    <p class="article_text" style="overflow: hidden;">
    This isn’t a wishy-washy philosophical mindset change. This kind of approach can have real 
    results on real people. People who are focused on global love and acceptance, and are willing to 
    focus on finding themselves and societal advancement over fame and prestige are more likely to foster a 
    world where global problems like racism, environmental degradation, and poverty is a shrinking minority. 
    The real problem, though, is how to practically implement this. Enter Neohumanism. As reflected in 
    Dr. Ghista’s and Acarya Satyamitrananda’s talk, Baba states that the educational system needs reformation. 
    The education system needs to provide students with real world assets like communication, acceptance, 
    love, and intellectual vitality in addition to math, science, and social studies. NHE is a new way of 
    looking at this.

    <br><br>

    Dr. Dhanjoo Ghista brought a powerful narrative to this-- NHE shouldn’t just be limited to early childhood. 
    It should be a way of life throughout the development of the brain, especially for students headed to c
    ollege. There is a lot of research that need to be done on a breadth of topics including meditation, 
    microvita, PROUT, medicine, and the arts. Moreover, for students who don’t get the NHE values in their 
    early childhood, introducing a focus on human skills is integral. In order to bring NHE values to as 
    many people as possible, we need to create NHE universities and research facilities.

    <br><br>

    Dada Satyamitrananda states that the NHE model is a model that places the primary concern on building the right 
    personality traits in a child. Academic qualifications, ie test scores and GPA, are secondary. This is in 
    line with popular thought and research-- we, as a species, are a very social society. Having integrity, 
    resilience, intellectual vitality, and practical skills like money managing come in more handy than the 
    Pythagorean theorem. NHE takes this into account.

    <br><br>

    Dr. Dhanjoo Ghista outlines the ideal university for NHE. He remarked that the university should have research 
    facilities for everything from physics to arts to medicine. NHE Universities need to be multidisciplinary 
    to better encourage mixing of different disciplines. Universities should have a  college of Humanities 
    and Social Sciences, Sciences and Mathematics, Engineering, Management Science, Business Administration, 
    Smart Cities and Hospital Healthcare Management, Law, Governance and Public Administration, Education, 
    Sports Science and Engineering, Yoga and Meditation, and Medicine and Health Sciences.

    <br><br>

    Both Dr. Ghista and Dada Satyamitrananda emphasize that NHE education reforms need to happen as soon 
    as possible. Ensuring that everyone has access to NHE schools without any socio-economic, language, 
    religious, or cultural barriers is one of the biggest goals of Ananda Marga.
