    <p class="article_text" style="overflow: hidden;"> On November 8, 2020, religious leaders from around 
    the world joined together in a UN Conference to talk Climate Change and its effects on all of us. 
    Particularly, SDG-13. Religious authority can have paramount influence on the dissemination of knowledge 
    and preventing bias. The UN recognizes that religious organizations need to be included in the conversation. 
    There were media, Ananda Marga, Sikh, UN, medical, cultural, and many more perspectives, moderated by 
    Dileepkumar Thankappan, a UN representative. You can see the full video 
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dileepkumar.thankappan.10/videos/391938458660800/">here</a>.

    Acarya Rudrananda Avadhuta started the discussion by remarking that the rate at which the climate change is 
    alarming and precedent, but climate change has happened in the past, and the main goal is to adapt with 
    the changing Earth. He pointed out that we should be focusing on adaptation technology and strategies 
    more than now; the climate may no longer be in our hands. He stated that we have to work for a global 
    civilization and work together to face the climate crisis. We need to create a congenial atmosphere to 
    “make this Earth heaven”. <br><br>

    Chip Commins, Chairman and CEO American Renewable Energy Institute  believes that Clean Energy is 
    biggest problem facing us today. He advocates for renewable energy and technologies, and that leaders 
    from around the world rally behind it. He believes we need to immediately cease fossil fuels immediately, 
    and that the Green New Deal and President Biden’s plan for climate action are effective ways to do so, 
    because “if America leads, the world will follow”. He notes that we can follow the examples Xie Bastida, 
    Greta Thunberg, and Alexandria Villaseñor have set.

    Dr. Remi Alapo, a UN representative for Nigeria’s Consortium for Women noted that women are affected on a 
    larger scale due to climate change. In rural areas, they often  “have to trek for hours to purchase 
    food so they can feed their children”. Therefore, she advocates for women to be included in the process 
    of decision making. Moreover, she echoes Mr. Haranda Singh’s comment that “the poor are feeling the brunt 
    of this situation…must discourage consumerism”. <br><br>

   Isaiah Chabala, UN representative of Zambia, remarked that the United States should rejoin Paris agreement. 
   He said that “We are living in a time where, I would say, are quadruple pandemics”, which are climate change, 
   economic depression, a hunger pandemic, and a racial pandemic (systemic and institutional racism). 
   He mentions that “all of these pandemics imapcts are interconnected” which “end up disproportionately 
   disadvantaging the vulnerable among us”. He also notes that the spiritual dimension of this issue is 
   important. Chabala, echoing Commins, believes that renewable energy and a wealth of green jobs should be 
   accessible to everyone. The US should join Paris agreement and WHO. He also emphasized that there is a 
   need for wealthy countries to lead the way and ensure that they live by their commitments. Particularly, 
   there is a need for religious communities to endorse climate change and spread a common message of 
   “protecting our common home”.
